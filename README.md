# Reset-A-Computer-For-Repairs-By-A-Third-Party
My list of things to do with a computer before I consider it able to be send in for repairs without risking to much "data on the journey".

  - delete browser-caches
  - delete all saved passwords within those browsers
  - clear the windows credential store
  - delete all virtual machines
  - uninstall installed software (e.g. automatedLab)
  - remove all repositories and the project directory
  - check that git on that computer is not authenticated to interact with my github account anymore
  - remove and unauthorize password safe access
  - set password to something simple
  - verify that there are not any other remainings pointing to me or containing personal data
